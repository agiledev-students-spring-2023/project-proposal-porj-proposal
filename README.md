# Project Proposal

RESERVATION AID

## Collaboration

Hillary Davis

### Project title

ResyMade

### What and why?

ResyMade aims to make reservations at highly acclaimed resturaunts that are difficult to get into, and sends updates on those resturaunts with openings and walk-in availability in real time. Furthermore, it highlights upcoming events that are popular, and aids in booking them.

### For whom?

This is for the average person, espescially those in large metropolitan areas, or visitors who want to check out popular restuaunts upon visiting a new city. It is for fans of particular artists, and events that want to ensure they are able to find tickets at an event of their choosing.

### How?

With regard to snagging resturaunt reservations, the system will traverse popular reservation holding sites and find cancellations based on a date/ time frame given by the user and make reservations for that resturaunt on that time if cancellations, or openings appear. Furthermore, it will monitor event posting sites based on events the user has expressed interest in, and notify users of events as they appear that are related to their interests and convey the popularity of said events, and aid in booking for those events as well in the way a bot would.

### Scope

This project proposal does not seem too tricky on the frontend as it should simply link to reservation sites, but on the backend it would take some effort to constantly monitor sites such as opentable, resy, etc. Similarly it would track events based on keywords for event sites such as ticketmaster and stubhub to track events as they appear on those sites, and would attempt to make bookings.
